# Weather Prediction during World War II
<p>While exploring the Aerial Bombing Operations of World War Two dataset, and recalling that the D-Day landings were nearly postponed due to poor weather, I sought out weather reports from the period to compare with missions in the bombing operations dataset.</p>

<p>The dataset used here contains information on weather conditions recorded on each day at various weather stations around the world. Information includes precipitation, snowfall, temperatures, wind speed and whether the day included thunderstorms or other poor weather conditions.</p>

<p>The following tasks are to be performed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean the data</li>
  <li>To determine wether there is a relationship between daily maximum and minimum temperature</li>
  <li>To determine wether the maximum temperature can be predicted using the minimum temperature</li>
